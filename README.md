Built on the experimental [Window: showDirectoryPicker() API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showDirectoryPicker). So far my testing has confirmed it only works in Chrome. For some reason even Chromium-based browsers such as Arc and Brave do not work as they do not properly handle it after selecting a folder.
